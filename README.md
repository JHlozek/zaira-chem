# Automated ML for Chemistry

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This package provides an AutoML solution to perform supervised ML on chemistry datasets.

We prioritise computational performance for low-resourced settings. Training takes time but is feasible on a conventional computer.

Works on regression and classification.
